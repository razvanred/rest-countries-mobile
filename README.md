## 💟 Huge thanks to…

- [Chris Banes](https://chrisbanes.me/), with his [tivi.app](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi): his project not only taught me during the years
    about the Android development, but also shaped me as a developer in a general way
- Although I never participated to this event, the [DroidKaigi](https://github.com/DroidKaigi) conference applications helped me
    during the early stages of my journey, and I am deeply grateful for the hard work the team is putting every year
- All the contributors of the mentioned libraries
- [REST Countries API contributors](https://gitlab.com/restcountries/restcountries)
